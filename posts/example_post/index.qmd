## Second header

The `title` defined in the header of the file is the header 1 for the blog post, so we always start with a `h2` header[^1]. This site was built following the blog of Samantha Csik [@csik2022].

[^1]: This is a footnote, which will be automatically included in the footnotes section on render.
