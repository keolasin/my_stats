## About me

My name is Matthew Reyes (he/him/his).

I'm an aspiring public health professional and data scientist. I'm most passionate about digital health equity, epidemiology, and improving community health.

I spend my free time with my dog, Bisbee, and getting outdoors to climb rocks or bike around.
